Project problem statement   
Project solutions and analysis   
Code implementation for two clients   


Problem restatement:   
Two client’s portfolios need re-weighting according to three models from the Home Office. In the re-weighting process, 
firstly, three primary characteristics should exactly match the model. What’s more, there will have penalty from the difference 
of secondary characteristics and each of the asset classes. Therefore, it is required to choose a model and reweight the portfolio 
to fulfill the exact match of primary characteristics and obtain least penalty of differences. The portfolio is limited to funds 
which the client already has and plus no more than one fund.
